# Ocypode

I like Rust and I like SIM racing. I'm merging the two into this little project to read iRacing telemetry, display it live, and provide helpful alerts to improve driving style in real time. [Ocypodes are the fastest crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocypode).

## Status

The live stats are working, displaying basic telemetry and alerts. The offline analysis portion is not completed yet.
