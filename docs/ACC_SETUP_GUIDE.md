  * **Suspension:** Increase Ride Height.  
  * **Suspension:** Stiffen Springs (Prevent compression).  
  * **Dampers:** Stiffen Fast Bump.

### **🛑 Braking**

* **⚠️ The Problem: FRONT LOCKING**  
  * **Brakes:** Move Bias Rearward.  
  * **Brakes:** Reduce Brake Pressure/Power.

  * **Aerodynamics:** Reduce Rear Ride Height.  
  * **Suspension:** Stiffen Front Springs (Reduce dive).  
  * **Dampers:** Stiffen Front Bump.

**3\. Tyres & Geometry**

*Check tyre HUD or Telemetry after a few laps.*

### **🌡️ Temperature & Pressure**

* **⚠️ Tyres are OVERHEATING**  
  * **Ducts:** Open Brake Ducts (Cooling).  
  * **Setup:** Soften Suspension (Less energy put into tyres).  
  * **Driving:** Reduce aggression / steering angle.  
* **⚠️ Tyres are COLD / GRAINING**  
  * **Ducts:** Close Brake Ducts (Retain heat).  
  * **Setup:** Stiffen Suspension (More energy put into tyres).  
  * **Alignment:** Increase Toe (Generates friction heat).

### **📐 Wear Patterns (Camber/PSI)**

* **⚠️ Inner Wear \> Outer Wear:** Too much Negative Camber.  
* **⚠️ Outer Wear \> Inner Wear:** Too much Positive Camber (Not enough negative).  
* **⚠️ Center Wear \> Edge Wear:** Pressure too High.  
* **⚠️ Edge Wear \> Center Wear:** Pressure too Low.

**4\. Race Conditions (Wet / End of Race)**

### **🌧️ Wet Track Setup**

* **Ride Height:** Increase (Avoid aquaplaning).  
* **Wings:** Increase Maximum Downforce.  
* **Suspension:** Soften Springs and ARBs significantly.  
* **Brakes:** Move Bias Rearward (Front grip is limited).  
* **Diff:** Lower Preload (Smoother rotation).

### **⛽ Fuel Load Changes**

* **Qualifying (Low Fuel):** Car is lighter. You can run lower ride heights and softer springs compared to full race load.  
* **Race (High Fuel):** Car is heavier. Increase ride height or stiffen springs to prevent bottoming out.

**📝 Key Legend**

* **Springs:** Controls weight transfer speed and pitch/roll magnitude.  
* **Dampers (Bump/Rebound):** Controls *how fast* the springs compress or extend.  
* **ARB (Anti-Roll Bar):** Connects left and right suspension; controls body roll balance.  
* **Aero (Wing/Splitter):** Air pressure pushing the car down for grip at speed.

**5\. Advanced Damping: Slow vs. Fast**

*Distinguish between **Driver Inputs** (Slow) and **Track Surface** (Fast) to fine-tune handling.*

**The Golden Rule:**

* **Slow Damping:** Controls the **Car's Body** (Pitch, Roll, Squat). Occurs during braking, steering, and accelerating.  
* **Fast Damping:** Controls the **Wheels** (Impacts). Occurs when hitting kerbs, bumps, or potholes.

### **📍 Kerbs & Bumps (Fast Damping)**

*This controls how the suspension reacts to sharp impacts (High shaft velocity).*

* **⚠️ The Problem: BOUNCING / LAUNCHING** (Car skips or jumps off the kerb)  
  * **Diagnosis:** The suspension is too stiff to absorb the impact energy.  
  * **Adjustment:** **Soften Fast Bump** (Allows wheel to retract up instantly).  
  * **Adjustment:** **Soften Fast Rebound** (Allows wheel to extend back down to track instantly).  
* **⚠️ The Problem: BOTTOMING OUT** (Hard metallic strike *after* a large bump)  
  * **Diagnosis:** The suspension compressed too easily and hit the bump stops.  
  * **Adjustment:** **Stiffen Fast Bump** (Slows down the compression on impact).  
  * **Adjustment:** **Increase Ride Height** (If damping alone cannot fix it).  
* **⚠️ The Problem: OSCILLATION AFTER BUMP** (Car continues to bounce after the kerb)  
  * **Diagnosis:** The spring energy isn't being controlled after the impact.  
  * **Adjustment:** **Stiffen Fast Rebound** (Stops the spring from extending too fast after compression).

### **📍 Driver Inputs & Chassis Balance (Slow Damping)**

*This controls how fast the car settles into a corner (Low shaft velocity).*

* **⚠️ The Problem: LAZY / SLUGGISH RESPONSE** (Car feels like a boat)  
  * **Diagnosis:** Weight transfer is happening too slowly.  
  * **Adjustment:** **Stiffen Slow Bump** (Resists the roll/dive, making it feel sharper).  
  * **Adjustment:** **Stiffen Slow Rebound** (Controls the unloaded side from lifting too fast).  
* **⚠️ The Problem: HARSH / TWITCHY** (Car reacts too violently to inputs)  
  * **Diagnosis:** Weight transfer is too sudden, breaking traction.  
  * **Adjustment:** **Soften Slow Bump** (Slows down the roll, giving the tyre time to grip).  
* **⚠️ The Problem: EXCESSIVE DIVE (Braking)**  
  * **Action:** **Stiffen Front Slow Bump** (Support the nose).  
* **⚠️ The Problem: EXCESSIVE SQUAT (Acceleration)**  
  * **Action:** **Stiffen Rear Slow Bump** (Support the rear).
